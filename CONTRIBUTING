fastFrag is UNLICENSED http://unlicense.org/

If you would like your patch included please sign the WAIVER for any non-trivial patches. This is a sad reality of the modern legal concerns regarding copyright. But it's fairly quick and only applies to large or significant alterations  to the code base.

Run: 

gpg --no-version --armor --sign WAIVER


More exact details can be found under: Unlicensing Contributions at http://unlicense.org/

There are also explicit instructions on how other unlisence (public domain) projects handle this:

Finally, following the aforementioned links practices, contributions of less than 15 lines of code can be considered 'trivial', as per the following:

    Also, I'll be following the FSF's rule of thumb [6] here, according to
    which contributions totaling less than 15 lines of new code can safely
    be considered "trivial" for legal purposes, in which case no waiver is
    needed. Hence I've already previously merged e.g. a small patch [7]
    from Pius, which fulfilled these criteria.
